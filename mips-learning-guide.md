# Complete Guide to Learning MIPS Assembly Programming

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

### 1.1 MIPS Architecture Basics
- MIPS is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture
- 32-bit architecture with fixed-length instructions
- Load-store architecture: only load/store instructions can access memory
- 32 general-purpose registers
- All instructions have exactly three operands

### 1.2 Register Set
```
General Purpose Registers:
$zero ($0)  - Always contains 0
$at ($1)    - Assembler temporary
$v0-$v1     - Values for function returns and expression evaluation
$a0-$a3     - Arguments for function calls
$t0-$t9     - Temporary registers
$s0-$s7     - Saved registers
$k0-$k1     - Reserved for OS kernel
$gp         - Global pointer
$sp         - Stack pointer
$fp         - Frame pointer
$ra         - Return address
```

## 2. Program Structure

### 2.1 Basic Program Layout
```mips
.data               # Data segment
    # Variable declarations go here

.text               # Code segment
.globl main         # Declare main as a global label
main:              # Main program entry point
    # Instructions go here
```

### 2.2 Data Types and Declaration
```mips
.byte       # 8-bit integer
.half       # 16-bit integer
.word       # 32-bit integer
.float      # 32-bit floating-point
.double     # 64-bit floating-point
.asciiz     # Null-terminated string
.space      # Reserve block of bytes
```

## 3. Essential Instructions

### 3.1 Data Movement
```mips
li   $t0, 5        # Load immediate
la   $t0, label    # Load address
lw   $t0, 0($t1)   # Load word
sw   $t0, 0($t1)   # Store word
move $t0, $t1      # Move between registers
```

### 3.2 Arithmetic Operations
```mips
add  $t0, $t1, $t2 # Addition
sub  $t0, $t1, $t2 # Subtraction
mul  $t0, $t1, $t2 # Multiplication

```

### 3.3 Logical Operations
```mips
and  $t0, $t1, $t2 # Bitwise AND
or   $t0, $t1, $t2 # Bitwise OR
xor  $t0, $t1, $t2 # Bitwise XOR
nor  $t0, $t1, $t2 # Bitwise NOR
sll  $t0, $t1, 2   # Shift left logical
srl  $t0, $t1, 2   # Shift right logical
```

### 3.4 Control Flow
```mips
beq  $t0, $t1, label # Branch if equal
bne  $t0, $t1, label # Branch if not equal
bgt  $t0, $t1, label # Branch if greater than
blt  $t0, $t1, label # Branch if less than
j    label           # Jump
jal  label           # Jump and link (for functions)
jr   $ra             # Jump register (return from function)
```

# MIPS Register Guide: Detailed Explanation and Usage

## 1. Zero Register ($zero or $0)
- **Purpose**: Always contains the value 0
- **When to use**: 
  - When you need a constant value of 0
  - For comparison operations
  - To clear a register
```mips
# Example uses of $zero
add  $t0, $t1, $zero    # Copy value from $t1 to $t0
beq  $t0, $zero, label  # Branch if $t0 equals 0
```

## 2. Assembly Temporary ($at or $1)
- **Purpose**: Reserved for the assembler
- **When to use**: 
  - DON'T! This is for assembler use only
  - The assembler uses it for expanding pseudo-instructions
```mips
# The assembler might use $at for pseudo-instructions like:
blt  $t0, $t1, label    # This gets expanded using $at
```

## 3. Function Results ($v0-$v1 or $2-$3)
- **Purpose**: Hold values returned by functions
- **When to use**:
  - $v0 is used for system calls
  - For returning values from functions
  - When evaluating expressions
```mips
# System call example
li   $v0, 1        # System call code for print_int
syscall

# Function return example
move $v0, $t0      # Store return value
jr   $ra           # Return from function
```

## 4. Arguments ($a0-$a3 or $4-$7)
- **Purpose**: Pass arguments to functions
- **When to use**:
  - When calling functions that take parameters
  - For system call parameters
```mips
# Function call example
move $a0, $t0      # First argument
move $a1, $t1      # Second argument
jal  function      # Call function

# System call example
li   $v0, 4        # print_string syscall
la   $a0, message  # Load address of string to print
syscall
```

## 5. Temporaries ($t0-$t9 or $8-$15, $24-$25)
- **Purpose**: Hold temporary values
- **When to use**:
  - For short-term storage
  - When you don't need to preserve values across function calls
  - In arithmetic or logical operations
```mips
# Example of temporary usage
li   $t0, 5        # Load immediate value
add  $t1, $t0, $t2 # Perform calculation
sw   $t1, 0($s0)   # Store result
```

## 6. Saved Temporaries ($s0-$s7 or $16-$23)
- **Purpose**: Hold long-term values that must be preserved
- **When to use**:
  - For variables that need to survive function calls
  - For loop counters
  - For important values that shouldn't be overwritten
```mips
# Example of saved register usage
# Note: Must be saved/restored in functions
loop:
    addi $s0, $s0, 1    # Increment loop counter
    blt  $s0, 10, loop  # Branch if less than 10
```

## 7. Kernel Registers ($k0-$k1 or $26-$27)
- **Purpose**: Reserved for operating system use
- **When to use**:
  - DON'T! These are for OS interrupt/exception handlers only
```mips
# These registers should never appear in your code
# They are used by the OS for handling interrupts
```

## 8. Global Pointer ($gp or $28)
- **Purpose**: Points to static data in memory
- **When to use**:
  - When accessing global variables
  - Generally managed by the compiler/assembler
```mips
# Example of global pointer usage
lw   $t0, 0($gp)   # Load global variable
sw   $t1, 4($gp)   # Store to global variable
```

## 9. Stack Pointer ($sp or $29)
- **Purpose**: Points to the top of the stack
- **When to use**:
  - When pushing/popping from the stack
  - When allocating local variables
  - In function prologues/epilogues
```mips
# Stack operations example
addi $sp, $sp, -8   # Allocate space on stack
sw   $t0, 0($sp)    # Push $t0
sw   $t1, 4($sp)    # Push $t1

# Later...
lw   $t1, 4($sp)    # Pop $t1
lw   $t0, 0($sp)    # Pop $t0
addi $sp, $sp, 8    # Deallocate stack space
```

## 10. Frame Pointer ($fp or $30)
- **Purpose**: Points to the current stack frame
- **When to use**:
  - In complex functions with many local variables
  - When you need stable references to stack variables
```mips
# Frame pointer usage example
move $fp, $sp       # Set up frame pointer
addi $sp, $sp, -20  # Allocate local variables
```

## 11. Return Address ($ra or $31)
- **Purpose**: Holds the return address for functions
- **When to use**:
  - In function calls
  - Must be saved if your function calls other functions
```mips
# Function call example with nested calls
main:
    jal  function    # Call function

function:
    # Save return address if we call other functions
    sw   $ra, 0($sp) # Save return address
    jal  another     # Call another function
    lw   $ra, 0($sp) # Restore return address
    jr   $ra         # Return to caller
```

## Register Usage Guidelines

### 1. Caller-Saved vs. Callee-Saved
- Caller-saved ($t0-$t9): Must be saved by the calling function if needed
- Callee-saved ($s0-$s7): Must be saved by the called function if used

### 2. Function Call Protocol
```mips
function:
    # Prologue
    addi $sp, $sp, -32    # Allocate stack space
    sw   $ra, 28($sp)     # Save return address
    sw   $fp, 24($sp)     # Save frame pointer
    sw   $s0, 20($sp)     # Save saved registers
    sw   $s1, 16($sp)     # that we'll use
    
    # Function body
    # ... function code ...
    
    # Epilogue
    lw   $s1, 16($sp)     # Restore saved registers
    lw   $s0, 20($sp)
    lw   $fp, 24($sp)     # Restore frame pointer
    lw   $ra, 28($sp)     # Restore return address
    addi $sp, $sp, 32     # Deallocate stack space
    jr   $ra              # Return
```

### 3. System Call Usage
Common system calls and their register usage:
```mips
# Print integer
li   $v0, 1        # print_int syscall
move $a0, $t0      # Integer to print
syscall

# Print string
li   $v0, 4        # print_string syscall
la   $a0, message  # Address of string
syscall

# Read integer
li   $v0, 5        # read_int syscall
syscall
move $t0, $v0      # Save input value

# Exit program
li   $v0, 10       # exit syscall
syscall
```

### 4. Best Practices
1. Always save registers according to conventions
2. Document register usage in comments
3. Be consistent with register allocation
4. Use meaningful register choices for better code readability
5. Consider register pressure when designing functions

Remember: Good register management is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free MIPS assembly code. Following these conventions makes your code more maintainable and helps prevent subtle bugs.
